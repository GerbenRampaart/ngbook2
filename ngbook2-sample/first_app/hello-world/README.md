# ng-book 2: hello-world app

> A bare bones, sanity check Angular 2 app

This project shows you how to create the simplest possible Angular 2 app.

## Dependencies

Before you get started, you need to make sure you have node.js installed. We'll be using `npm` to run this project (`npm` will be installed when you install node.js). You can [install node.js here](https://nodejs.org/en/).

## Installing

First, you need to make sure you install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Then we will 

- compile our TypeScript code and
- host the app on local development server 

by running the command:

```
npm run go
```

Then visit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser. You should see the text "Hello world".

## Getting Help

In the case where it doesn't work, the first thing to try is looking at the developer console in your browser.

If that doesn't work, [come chat with us](https://gitter.im/ng-book/ng-book)!
